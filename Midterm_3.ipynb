    "Train a neural network for sequences of your choice (LSTM, GRU, Convolutional, Clockwork RNN, ...) to predict the Benzene (C6H6 column) based on the sensor measurements timeseries (PT08.* columns) being fed in input to the recurrent model. Evaluate the predictive accuracy of the network on the task (using appropriately training/validation splits).  Confront the perfomance of this model, with another recurrent neural network trained to predict benzene one-step-ahead, i.e. given the current benzene measuement, predict its next value.\n",
